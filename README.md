# Contents of this repository
This Github repository encapsulates all the other classification projects using Machine Learning that I've done.
# Purpose of this repository 
All the projects I've done are detailed in a very pedagogical way for anyone who wants to learn about Machine Learning on various classification problems
# Realized projects and performances
## Ionosphere classification
### Brief description of the project
The goal is to classify the state of the ionosphere following sonar measurements into two classes: Good (g) and Bad (b)
### Achieved performances
